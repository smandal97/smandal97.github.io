I am a VITA postdoctoral fellow at the University of Virginia, working in the [SIE3D group](https://sites.google.com/view/sie3d/home). I received my PhD degree from Purdue University, under the supervision of [Prof. Paul Duffell](https://www.physics.purdue.edu/duffell/index.html).

I study high velocity astrophysical outflows and work on devising new numerical techniques to overcome the challenges associated with modeling such outflows. I developed a novel hydro code called Sprout that can expand its computational domain following the fluid flow, thus providing a cheap way to study outflows that grow over several orders of magnitude in space and time. My particular interest lies in supernovae, or explosive deaths of stars. I also have experience working with astrophysical jets, both from a theoretical and an observational point of view.


When I'm not working, I'm usually busy cooking, stargazing, playing badminton, or hanging out with Bayek or Kratos on my gaming console. I hail from the metropolitan city of Kolkata (lovingly called the 'City of Joy') in the coastal state of West Bengal, India.

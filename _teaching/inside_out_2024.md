I was a mentor for [https://www.physics.purdue.edu/duffell/outreach.html](Physics Inside Out), a five-day on-campus summer program for grade 7 and 8 students for the Fall 2024 academic year. Going beyond typical classroom curricula, Physics Inside Out engaged students with fundamental concepts and current scientific research in various areas of physics. I had the opportunity to lead a lesson called Scaling the Solar System, in which students built a scaled model of the Solar System on campus.

excerpt: 'We develop a suite of 3D hydrodynamic models of supernova remnants (SNRs) expanding against the circumstellar medium (CSM) to study the Rayleigh-Taylor Instability (RTI) forming at the expansion interface. The angular power spectrum of turbulence in these SNR models exhibits a dominant angular mode, which is a diagnostic of their ejecta density profile as found by previous studies. We find that perturbations in the density field (whether imposed on the ejecta or the CSM) do not influence the anisotropy of the remnant significantly unless they have a very large amplitude and form large-scale coherent structures. In any case, these clumps can only affect structures on large angular scales. The power spectra on small angular scales is completely independent of the initial clumpiness and only governed by the growth and saturation of the Rayleigh-Taylor instability.'
